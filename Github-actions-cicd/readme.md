GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup
This repository demonstrates the setup of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions for a Node.js project.

Project Overview
This project includes a basic Node.js setup that uses GitHub Actions to:

Automatically build and test the project whenever changes are pushed to the main branch or pull requests are made.
Monitor the workflow status on GitHub.
Deploy the application (if applicable).
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before setting up the workflow, ensure that:

Node.js is installed locally.
GitHub repository is created.
GitHub Actions is enabled for the repository.

Key Features and Components:
CI (Continuous Integration):

The project runs automated tests on each code push or pull request.
It verifies that the code works across multiple versions of Node.js (currently 14.x and 16.x).
GitHub Actions:

This workflow uses GitHub Actions to set up the CI pipeline, which is triggered by push and pull request events.
The workflow is defined in the .github/workflows/node.js.yml file.
Node.js:

The project is built with Node.js as the runtime, and any necessary dependencies are installed and managed with npm (via npm ci).
The pipeline ensures that the Node.js environment is set up correctly for each job.
Automated Testing:

Tests are executed automatically using the npm test command, which runs the testing framework (like Jest, Mocha, etc.) defined in package.json.
Build Automation:

The npm run build command is run if a build script is defined in the package.json, allowing for automated builds before deployment.
